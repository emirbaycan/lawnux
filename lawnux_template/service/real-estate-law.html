Our services include:</p><ul><li>Drafting and negotiating easement agreements.</li><li>Advising on the enforcement of restrictive covenants and property restrictions.</li><li>Representing clients in disputes over easements, access rights, and property restrictions.</li></ul><h4><strong>Real Estate Financing</strong></h4><p>Real estate transactions often involve complex financing arrangements.

At <strong>Lawnux</strong>, we represent clients in both mediation and arbitration proceedings, helping them to achieve fair and timely resolutions. ADR can be particularly beneficial in disputes involving contracts, leases, or construction issues, where maintaining business relationships is a priority.</p>        </div>
